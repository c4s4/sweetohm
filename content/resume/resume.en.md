Professional Experience
-----------------------

### Since 2015: Freelance Developer

At the end of 2015, I left the Orange group to work as a Freelance:

- Since September 2016 I am XML and Java expert at Editons Lefebvre Sarrut. During this mission, I have conducted following projects:
  - Transformation from old Dalloz encyclopedia format to the new DTD (XML and XSLT 2.0).
  - Development of the new XML publication line for Dalloz books and encyclopedias (Java, Golang and XSLT 2.0).
- From December 2015 to August 2016 (9 months), I have been Java Expert at SQLI in Pessac. I have been technical referent on a computation batch project (proofs of concept, Spring Batch adoption, database migration scripts, package generation, continuous integration, etc). I have also work on transverse projects, such as reception of maintenance projects (code and database audits, securisation cost estimates), Python training and other missions.

### 2008-2015: Expert Engineer at Orange Applications for Business

In the Vodoo team (2008-2009) I worked on the video on demand project in a large team located in Bordeaux, Paris and Lille. I developed software in Java (on servers) and JavaScript (on set-top boxes).

In 2009 I volunteered to evaluate Talend and develop statistics batches, in 1013 and 3900 projects. These projects were finished using Python and SQL. The user interface, to display statistics results, was developed in Flash.

We then used this Python expertise in a video chat project for a bank, in the VisioCC project. We used Django to develop the administration backend and webservices called by the video chat written in Flash.

I then joined the Telefact team (2010-2013), to work on payment software (credit card and bill payment) to develop an administration backend using Django. I also implemented PCIDSS (data security standard) on payment softwares.

I then worked on MonSVI team (2013-2014) on statistics batches using Python and MySQL.

In 2014 I worked in the xMS team to refactor a protocol frontend named sgs-enabler. It had been developed in Java using NIO and we rewrote it in Go. This was a huge improvement in terms of of reliability and performance. This project was the subject of a presentation at BDX.IO, DevDays and Midi Techniques Orange, online at <http://sweetohm.net/slides/go-retour-experience/>.

Finally I joined mid-2014 the Cloud team to develop tools to manage virtual machines, in Python.

While working for Orange, I have developed tools that were released under Open Source license:

- Jitsu : unit test framework for JavaScript.
- DB_migration : database migration tool.
- Bee : build tool.

During these years I also organized many workshops and training sessions on Python, Django, YAML and Go.

### 2007-2008: Freelance Developer

After I left In-Fusio, I worked for one and a half years as freelance developer, on following missions:

- Kewego (1 week): I optimized a Java software for log parsing.
- Unedic (4 months): I developed an interface to connect to LDAP server for configuration purpose.
- CVF (9 months): Java expertise mission (see above).

### 2000-2007: Java and XML Expert at In-Fusio

In R&D department at In-fusio, a company in Bordeaux that developed games and JVM to run them on mobile phones (ExEn and EGE) and server software to download games. The Gamezilla platform has been managing interactions with players, downloads and SMS, for six years with an availability of more than 99%. There has been more than 20 million players that have done more than 30 million downloads and send more than 220 million interactions in 45 countries.

I developed about half of the Gamezilla platform, webapplications for the most part (Servlets, JSP and PHP, but also Python and Ruby).

I conceived the Gamezilla architecture, first as Java expert, then as software architect. I worked on performance, replacing EJBs with a Java library calling Oracle with optimized SQL queries, with a factor 10 improvement. I also worked on software development process, managing dependencies and implementing nightly builds, developing a suite of development tools and a centralized documentation, in a Wiki.

I had a technology watch activity on application servers (we choose BEA Weblogic), JMX (to manage Java applications), Maven (Java application build) and JSR 124 (Java Vending Machines).

I have organized internal training on Java, Object Oriented Programming, XML and XSLT.

I was also project manager for six months for Gamezilla team (with 6 developers).

### 1996-2000: Author, Speaker and Freelance Developer

I worked for Editions O'Reilly (French branch of O'Reilly in France):

- Co-author on *XML Précis et Concis* (localized in English, German and Japanese). I wrote the chapter on XSLT that was reused in *Webmaster in a Nutshell*.
- Co-translator on *Java Security*.
- Translator on *Extreme Programming Pocket Guide*.
- Technical rewriter on *Java Examples in a Nutshell*, *Ant précis et concis*, *Java et SOAP*, *Google à 200%* and *Java plus rapide, plus léger*.
- Author of articles and news on Edition O'Reilly website.
