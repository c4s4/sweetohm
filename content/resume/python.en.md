Here is a Python dedicated version of my resume. A [complete version is available here](http://sweetohm.net/resume/resume.en.html).

I started using Python in 1998 and have been using it as my preferred scripting language since then. I have also been using it with Django web framework for web development.

# Lead Backend Developer at Mieuxplacer.com *(since 2018-03)*

I am Lead Backend Developer at [mieuxplacer.com](http://mieuxplacer.com) since march 2018. I've been developing and maintaining the Python/Django backend:

- Migration of the REST API from [Django Rest Framework](http://www.django-rest-framework.org/) to a [custom framework](https://github.com/c4s4/django-rest).
- Synchronization tool between backend and Zoho CRM (with REST calls).
- Implementation of software development good practices:
  - Measurement of test code coverage (with [codecov.io](http://codecov.io)).
  - Implementation of automated integration tests.
  - Automation of code validation with Pylint on Git commits.
  - Great scale refactoring of code and data models.

# Expert Engineer at OAB *(2008-04 to 2015-10)*

OAB is a subsidiary company of Orange, the French historic telecommunications company.

After a bad experience with Talend, I have been using Python to implement computation batches, which were essentially big SQL queries. At this occasion I have developed a Python computation batch framework.

I have used this Python experience in a banking video chat application called VisioCC. We have been using Django to implement the administration backend and REST webservices called by the Flash video chat.

I have also used Python and Django to develop a configuration backend for Orange banking applications in Telefact team.

I have then reused my Python batch framework in MonSVI team to implement statistics batches.

I finally joined the Cloud team and used Python to develop tools to automate management of virtual machines running in VM-Ware.

While working for OAB, I have developed following tools released under Open Source license:

- [DB_migration](https://github.com/c4s4/db_migration): database migration tool.
- [mysql_commando](https://github.com/c4s4/mysql_commando): MySQL driver for Python.
- [CheeseShop](https://github.com/c4s4/cheeseshop): Python package repository.

# Java and XML Expert at In-Fusio *(2000-07 to 2007-04)*

In-Fusio was a mobile gaming company that developed its own Java Virtual Machine to download and run games on mobile phones.

I have started to use Python at In-Fusio to develop a server to deliver binaries downloaded by mobile phones. I have also used it to implement a continuous integration tool (in 2004).

At these occasions, I realized that Python was much faster than Java regarding development, and that its runtime performance were sometimes better that Java.

# Personal activities *(since 1998)*

I have given Python related talks:

- [Faut-t-il passer Ã  Python 3 ?](http://sweetohm.net/slides/python-3-migration/) at BDX.io in October 2015.
- [Migration BDD](http://sweetohm.net/slides/db-migration/) at BDX.io in October 2016.

Furthermore, I have many [Python projects on my Github account](https://github.com/c4s4?utf8=%E2%9C%93&tab=repositories&q=&type=&language=python):

- [db_migration](https://github.com/c4s4/db_migration) a database migration tool.
- [mail1](https://github.com/c4s4/mail1) a mail library, [available on PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/mail1/).
- [http1](https://github.com/c4s4/http1) a library to perform HTTP requests, [available on PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/http1/).
- [CheeseShop](https://github.com/c4s4/cheeseshop) a Python package repository, written in Go.
- [Pythenv](https://github.com/c4s4/pythenv) to launch a script creating a virtual environment at runtime.
- [python-continuum](https://github.com/c4s4/python-continuum) a minimalist continuous integration tool.
